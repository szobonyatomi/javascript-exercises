# JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

- Repository name: `javascript-exercises`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `1-2 weeks`
- Deployment strategy: Not needed for these exercises

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this challenge you will:

- be able to code using **JavaScript**

## The Mission 

The folder consists of 73 exercises, divided into 11 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

> ‚òùÔ∏è  Each exercise must be done.  

> ü§ü **NOTE:** The exercises in series 9 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

### ES2015+ ?

You will see very soon in your research which exist an "old" Javascript and a "new" Javascript, called ES6 or ES2015, and also ES2016, ES2017, etc.

What does it mean ? So, it should be a good idea to explain this mess in a watch - *wink, wink* - don't worry too much about it : for this exercices, retain that ES2015 is the new standard, and stay focus on this version.

### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  
This is a good practice that should always be applied. Maybe, you have already install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) on your machines. If not, do it ;). 
If you want to configure correctly the global settigs of npm [follow this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory).

We prepared for you a local server to use from your command line called [**s√®v√®**](https://github.com/leny/seve).

Then, use your terminal to *navigate* to your repo and run the following commands :

	npm install
	npm start

If everything ir right, your default's browser will be opened on the address [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).

## Specifics instructions

### Section 11 - fetch

For the *fetch* exercises, you are going to need to query a REST API.
We have provided you with a small script to run this API locally.

Open a second terminal, then _navigate_ to the repo folder. Then issue the following commands :

    npm run api

From there, you will have a REST API available at `http://localhost:3000`
